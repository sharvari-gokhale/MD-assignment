Explain to your grandparent how to use an ATM machine.

# Using an ATM 

To withdraw money from the ATM, perform the following steps:

1.	Go to an ATM and insert your ATM card in the card reader. Some instructions are displayed on the screen. As this screen is similar to the screen of your smartphone, it will be easy for you to interact.
  
    **Note:** Ensure that the ATM card is inserted such that the chip and the bank logo face upwards. 
   
2.	Select the language of your choice from the options displayed on the screen. 
3.	Enter the **four-digit PIN** using the keypad. The font size of numbers on the keypad is large, so it will be easily visible to you.
  
     _Caution: Be careful while entering your PIN to prevent it from being seen by onlookers._ 
  
     **Note:** Do not share the PIN with anyone. If you enter a wrong PIN for more than three times, then your ATM card might get blocked.
4.	Select **Withdraw Money** from the options displayed on the screen. 
5.	Select the account type as **Current** or **Savings**.
6.	Enter the **Amount to withdraw** by using the keypad and press **Enter**. 

    **Note:** Ensure that there is a sufficient balance available in the account.
  
7.	Collect the money from the cash dispenser. You can verify your cash, but I assure you that this service is error free, and you will receive the exact cash amount.
 
    **Note:** The cash dispenser shutter will close after a certain time, or the cash is retracted after a certain time if not collected.
    
8.	Collect the withdrawal receipt from the receipt printer. After you view the receipt, tear it, and then throw it in the dustbin for security reasons.
   
    **Note:** The withdrawal receipt is a proof of the transaction. It also contains details such as the available account balance after the withdrawal. You also have       an option to avoid the printed slip and check your account’s information on the screen or on the SMS sent to you on your registered mobile number.
9.	Complete the transaction process by pressing **Cancel** if you do not want to perform any further transactions.

Collect the ATM card before leaving the ATM. If ATM card is retained by the ATM machine, you need to collect it from the branch.
You would definitely be comfortable in using ATMs as it is as simple as using your smartphone which you recently learned and started operating efficiently. ATMs will also reduce your time and efforts as they are installed at many places like hospitals, railway stations, airports, and many other public places. This facility will allow you to carry less cash with you while travelling and you will be tension free for sure.
